# -Hospitality---Booking-Patterns-and-Revenue-Generation.

The project revolves around analyzing booking patterns and revenue generation in the accommodation booking (hospitality) industry, considering the significant impact of COVID-19. The objective is to help small to medium business owners sustain their operations by providing essential business reporting and visualizations to the upper management. These insights will enable high-level analysis and critical decision-making in the cost-intensive hospitality sector.

The project utilizes specific datasets that include booking data, squad mapping, property details, and primary-ID to property ID mapping. By leveraging this data, the project aims to generate key output metrics at a squad level. These metrics include total revenue per day, current month revenue per day, room nights per day, total cancellation nights per day, total cancellation value per day, total booking per month, and total room nights per month. These metrics provide comprehensive information about revenue, bookings, and cancellations, empowering management to evaluate performance and make informed decisions.

To determine the booking month and analyze revenue trends accurately, the check-in and check-out dates are utilized. The project entails leveraging Google Sheets and data manipulation techniques to extract and process the necessary information, enabling the creation of insightful reports and visualizations.

By presenting these findings through a well-designed dashboard, the project facilitates a high-level understanding of booking patterns, revenue trends, and cancellations. Ultimately, the objective is to equip management with the tools needed to navigate the challenges of the hospitality industry and make data-driven decisions for business sustainability.
